# Project

With this idea we aim to provide every student’s and employ’s use virtual mouse because we were see many students and employ’s not 
interested in use of keyboard mouse so we are decided why not use for virtual mouse. A computer technology continues to develop and 
people use of smaller and smaller electronic device cause smaller device use to easy and suitable to every person. It is real time 
application. This project remove the various external part like physical mouse and keyboard mouse. It is based on machine learning 
and python language. 

To use this project, we have to open our 3 fingers for mouse movement, 4 fingers for left click and for right click use 5 fingers.

As a computer technology continues to develop, people have smaller and smaller electronic device so we are simplify new technology 
(virtual mouse) within machine learning and python language. Increasingly we are recognizing the importance of human computing interaction
(HCI), and in particular vision based gesture and object recognition. In our project we propose novel a approach that uses a video device
to control the mouse system (mouse tasks).Several images processing algorithm to implement this. With helping this technology we are remove the external parts thus reduce the cost of hardware. 
Generally  for personal use in  computers and  laptops  we use  a physical mouse or touchpads  invented a long  time ago  and in this  '
project  requirement  for  external hardware is completely eliminated by using human computer interaction technology we detect hand  
movements and gestures for  mouse movements and mouse events

In the future, we plan to add more feature such as enlarging and shrinking window, closing window, etc. by using the palm and multiple 
fingers.
We can also open the browser or any drives.
